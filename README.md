# So what does it do?
This is a script that takes in a number, and prints out even or odd depending on if it is even or odd
# So what does it actually do?
It takes in a number, and makes a new python script to check if the number is even or odd

Oh yea, also, it only has a 1 in 6 chance of actually doing that 
# But why?
Why not?
# How do I use it?
`py checkEvenOrOdd.py <value>`
